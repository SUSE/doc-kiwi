      <para>The openSUSE KIWI Image System provides a complete operating
    system image solution for Linux supported hardware platforms as well
    as for virtualization systems like Xen, VMware, etc. The KIWI
    architecture was designed as a two level system. The first stage,
    based on a valid <emphasis>software package source</emphasis>,
    creates a so called <emphasis>unpacked image</emphasis> according to
    the provided image description. The second stage creates from a
    required unpacked image an operating system image. The result of the
    second stage is called a <emphasis>packed image</emphasis> or short
    an image. </para>

  <para>Because this document contains conceptual information about an
    image system, it is important to understand what an operating system
    image is all about. A normal installation process is starting from a
    given installation source and installs single pieces of software
    until the system is complete. During this process manual user
    intervention may be required. However, an operating system image
    represents an already completed <emphasis>installation</emphasis>,
    encapsulated as a file and optionally includes the configuration for
    a specific task. Such an operating system starts working as soon as
    the image has been brought to a system storage device, no matter if
    this is a volatile or non volatile storage. The process of creating
    an image takes place without user interaction. This means, all
    requirements of the encapsulated system have to be fulfilled before
    the image is created. All of this information is stored in the
      <emphasis>image description</emphasis>. </para>

  <para>The creation of an image with KIWI is always divided into two
    basic steps: the <emphasis>prepare</emphasis> and the
      <emphasis>create</emphasis> step. The create step requires the
    prepare step to be completed successfully. Within this first prepare
    step, KIWI builds a new root tree or, in KIWI speak, a new unpacked
    image. The building of a new root tree consists of the creation of
    the directory specified to hold it and the installation of the
    selected packages on it. The installation of software packages is
    driven by a package manager. KIWI supports the smart and zypper package
    managers. The prepare step executes the following major stages: </para>

      <formalpara>
        <title>Creating Root Directory</title>
        <para>To prevent accidental deletion of an existing root tree,
          KIWI will stop with an error message if this folder already
          exists, unless the option <option>--force-new-root</option> is
          used in which case the existing root will be deleted. </para>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <formalpara>
        <title>Installing Packages</title>
        <para>First the selected package manager (zypper by default) is
          instructed to use the repositories specified in the image
          description file. Then the packages specified in the bootstrap
          section are installed. These packages are installed externally
          to the target root system (i.&nbsp;e. not chroot’ed) and
          establish the initial environment, so the rest of the process
          may run chroot’ed. Essential packages in this section are
          filesystem and glibc-locale. In practice you only need to
          specify those two, since the rest of the packages will be
          pulled because of the dependency system. To save space in your
          image you could schedule a set of packages for deletion after
          the package installation phase is over by listing them in the
            <sgmltag>delete</sgmltag> section</para>

        <title>Executing User Defined config.sh Script</title>
        <para>At the end of the preparation stage the optional script
          named <filename>config.sh</filename> is called. This script
          should be used to configure the system which means, for
          example, the activation of services. For a detailed
          description what functions are already available to configure
          the system, refer to the <xref linkend="ref.kiwi.config.sh"/>

      <formalpara>
        <title>Managing New Root Tree</title>
        <para>At this point you can make changes on your unpacked image
          so it fits your purpose better. Bear in mind that changes at
          this point will be discarded and not repeated automatically if
          you rerun the <emphasis>prepare</emphasis> phase unless you
          include them in your original <filename>config.xml</filename>
          file and/or <filename>config.sh</filename> script. Please also
          note that the image description has been copied into the new
          root below the directory <filename class="directory"
              ><replaceable>new-root</replaceable>/image</filename>. Any
          subsequent create step will read the image description
          from the new root tree and not from the original
          image description location. According to this, if you need to
          change the image description data after the prepare call has
          finished, you need to change it inside the new root tree as
          well as in your original description directory to prevent
          loosing the change when your root tree will be removed later
          for some reason. </para>

  </itemizedlist>

  <para>After the prepare step has finished successfully, a subsequent
    building of an image file follows or, in KIWI speak, a new packed
    image. The building of an image requires a successfully prepared new
    root tree in the first place. Using this tree, multiple image types
    can be created. So to speak, it’s possible to create a VMware image
    and a Xen image from the same prepared root tree. The create step
    executes the following major stages: </para>

        <para>At the beginning of the creation stage the optional script

            <filename>config.sh</filename>. However, it is most often
          used to remove packages which were pulled in by a dependency,
          but are not really required for later use of the operating

    <para>Today’s Linux systems are using a special boot image to control
      the boot process. This boot image is called initrd. The Linux
      kernel loads this compressed cpio initial ramdisk into RAM and
      calls init or (if present) the program linuxrc. The KIWI image
      system also handles the creation of this boot image. Each
      image type has its own special boot code and shares the common
      parts in a set of module functions. The image descriptions for the
      boot images are provided by KIWI and thus the user has in almost
      all cases no need to take care for the boot image. </para>

    <para>Furthermore, KIWI automatically creates this boot image along
      with the requested image type. It does that by calling itself in a
      prepare and create call. There is no difference in terms of the
      description of such a boot image compared to the system image
      description. The system image description is the one the user
      creates and it represents the later operating system, whereas the
      boot image only lives temporarily in RAM as long as the system
      image will be activated. The boot image descriptions are stored in
        <filename>/usr/share/kiwi/image/*boot</filename> and can be
      built in the same way as the system image. A boot image without a
      corresponding system image doesn’t make sense, though. </para>

    <para> KIWI has been developed to be usable for any Linux
      distribution. However, each Linux distribution is different. On
      one hand, KIWI provides common code <!--FIXME--></para>

    <para>By design of a Linux distribution there are differences
      between each of them. With KIWI we provide on one hand the code
      which is common to all Linux distributions, according to standards
      and on the other hand there is also code where we have to
      distinguish between the distribution type. </para>

    <para>In the case of specific tasks mostly related to
      booting, KIWI provides a set of functions which all
      contain a distribution prefix. As this project uses SUSE Linux as
      base distribution, all required distribution specific tasks have
      been implemented for SUSE. Other distributions could be missing.
      The existing implementation for SUSE can be adapted to
      other distributions very easily, though. </para>

    <para>A look into the code therefore will show you functions which
      are prefixed by <quote>suse</quote> as well as scripts whose names
      starts with <quote>suse-</quote>. If you see such a prefix,
      script, or function, you can be assured that this is something
      distribution specific. If you plan to use KIWI with another
      distribution than SUSE, you need to adapt it. For example, the
      boot workflow is controlled by a program called
        <command>linuxrc</command> which in KIWI is a script represented
      by <command>suse-linuxrc</command>. Another example is the
      function <function>suseStripKernel</function>, which is able to
      remove everything but a specified list of kernel drivers from the
      SUSE kernel. </para>

    <para>The prefixed implementation allows us to integrate all the
      distribution specific tasks into one project but this of course
      requires the help and knowledge of the people who are familiar with
      their preferred Linux distribution. </para>
