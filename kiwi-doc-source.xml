  <para>Before you start to use any of the examples provided in the
    following chapters your build system has to have a valid
    installation source for the distribution you are about to create an
    image for. By default, all examples will connect to the network to
    find the installation source. It depends on your network bandwidth
    how fast an image creation process is and in almost all cases it is
    better to prepare a local installation source first. </para>

    <para> If you can make sure you have a local installation source
      it’s important to change the path attribute inside of the
      repository element of the appropriate example to point to your
      local source directory. A typically default repository element
      looks like the following: </para>

    <screen>&lt;repository type="yast2"&gt;
   <sgmltag class="sgmlcomment">&lt;source path="/image/CDs/full-11.0-i386"/&gt;</sgmltag>
   &lt;source path="opensuse://openSUSE:11.0/standard/"/&gt; 
&lt;/repository&gt;</screen>

    <para> The following procedure describes how to create a local SUSE
      installation source which is stored below the path <filename
        class="directory">/images/CDs</filename>. If you are using the
      local path as described in this document you only need to flip
      the given path information inside of the example
        <filename>config.xml</filename> file. </para>

    <procedure id="proc.instsourcesetup.local-inst">
      <step>
        <para>Find your SUSE standard installation CDs or the DVD and
          make them available to the build system. Most Linux systems
          auto-mount a previosly inserted media automatically. If this
          is the case you simply can change the directory to the auto
          mounted path below <filename class="directory"
            >/media</filename>. If your system doesn’t mount the device
          automatically you can do this with the following command: </para>
        <screen><command>mount</command> -o loop /dev/<replaceable>drive-device-name</replaceable> /mnt</screen>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>If you do not have a DVD but a CD set, copy the contents
          of <emphasis>all</emphasis> CDs into one directory. It’s
          absolutly important that you first start with the
            <emphasis>last</emphasis> CD and copy the first CD at last.
          In case of CDs you should have a bundly of 4 CDs. Copy them in
          the order 4 3 2 1. </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>Copy the contents of the CDs/DVD to your hard drive once
          you have access to the media. You need at least 4GB free space
          available. The following is intended to create a SUSE 11.0
          installation source: </para>

        <screen><command>mkdir</command> -p /image/CDs/full-11.0-i386/ 
<command>cp</command> -a /mnt/* /image/CDs/full-11.0-i386/ </screen>

        <para>Remember if you have a CD set start with number 4 first
          and after that unplugg the CD and insert the next one to
          repeat the copy command until all CDs are copied into to
          /image </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
