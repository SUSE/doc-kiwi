   <ulink url="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</ulink> is a nice framework to
   implement consistent processing/testing work environments based on
   Virtualization technologies. In order to run a system, Vagrant needs
   so-called <quote>boxes</quote>. A box is a TAR archive containing a virtual
   disk image and some metadata.
  </para>
  <para>
   To build Vagrant boxes, you can use <ulink
   url="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">veewee</ulink> which builds boxes
   based on AutoYaST, or <ulink url="http://packer.io">Packer</ulink>, which
   is provided by Vagrant itself.
  </para>
  <para>
   Both tools are based on the official distribution media (DVDs). If such
   media does not exist (for example if the distribution is still under
   development or you want to use a collection of your own repositories), the
   KIWI way of building images might be helpful. In addition you can use the
   KIWI image description as source for the <ulink
   url="http://openbuildservice.org/">Open Build Service</ulink> which then
   allows building and maintaining boxes in the Build Service as a plus.

  <title>Building Vagrant Boxes</title>

  <para>
   The following example shows how to build a Just enough Operating System
   (JeOS) based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 12:
  </para>
  <screen>kiwi --build suse-SLE12-JeOS --add-profile vagrant --type vmx -d /tmp/my-box</screen>
  <para>
   The build result is written to <filename>/tmp/my-box</filename>. The
   <filename class="extension">.box</filename> and <filename
   class="extension">.json</filename> files are needed in order to add and run
   the box in Vagrant. The <filename class="extension">.box</filename> file is
   a TAR archive containing the virtual disk image for the selected
   virtualization provider.  In this example it is a qcow2 image to be used
   with libvirt and some metadata which mostly duplicates the information from
   the '.json' file to have it packaged in one place, too.

  </para>
  <para>
   The system installed on the virtual disk has to fulfill some requirements
   which are documented at <ulink
   url="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html"/>. The KIWI template
   makes sure these requirements are met:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     installation of mandatory packages: <package>sudo</package>,
     <package>openssh</package> and <package>rsync</package>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     users <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and <systemitem
     class="username">vagrant</systemitem> are both configured to use
     <literal>vagrant</literal> as password
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     integration of the Vagrant public SSH key from <ulink
     url="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/tree/master/keys"/>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     starting <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem> daemon at boot time
     with <literal>UseDNS</literal> set to <literal>no</literal>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     sudo configured to allow passwordless root permissions for the
     <systemitem class="username">vagrant</systemitem> user
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Using the box requires a correct Vagrant installation on your machine. The
   <systemitem class="daemon">libvirtd</systemitem> daemon and the libvirt
   default network need to be running.
  </para>

  <para>
   Adding the box to Vagrant can be done in two ways. Either by using the
   <filename class="extension">.box</filename> file and providing a name at
   the command line:
  </para>
  <screen>cd /tmp/my-box
vagrant box add my-box LimeJeOS-SLE12.x86_64-1.13.1.libvirt.box</screen>
  <para>
   or by utilizing the <filename class="extension">.json</filename> file to
   provide metadata such as a version number (similar to the boxes downloaded
   from <ulink url="https://vagrantcloud.com/"/>):
  </para>

  <screen>cd /tmp/my-box
vagrant box add LimeJeOS-SLE12.x86_64-1.13.1.libvirt.json</screen>

<remark condition="clarity">
 2015-07-29 - fs: Are the cd commands really needed? What about
vagrant box add /tmp/my-box/LimeJeOS-SLE12.x86_64-1.13.1.libvirt.json ?
</remark>

  <para>
   With either method, you can now boot the box and log in:
  </para>

  <screen><prompt>root # </prompt>cd /tmp/my-box
<prompt>root # </prompt>vagrant init my-box
<prompt>root # </prompt>vagrant up --provider libvirt
<prompt>root # </prompt>vagrant ssh
 This is the Lime-JeOS SLE12 Linux System...

  <tip>
   <title>Vagrant with Docker</title>
   <para>
    Building boxes for the libvirt, VMware or VirtualBox providers requires to
    build images with the disk format required by the provider. A Docker based
    box, however, has no such requirements. Therefore building a Docker based
    box for Vagrant in KIWI does not differ from building a regular Docker
    image as described in <xref linkend="chap.docker"/>.
