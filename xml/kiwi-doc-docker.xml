   Linux Containers (LXC) provide operating system-level virtualization,
   utilizing Control Groups (cgroups). The virtualization is similar to
   technologies in OpenVZ, Linux-VServer, FreeBSD jails, AIX Workload
   Partitions, and Solaris Containers. The network and process space of the
   container is separated from the host resources by using namespaces. Kernel
   space information is mounted into the container root filesystem using the
   <filename>fstab</filename> file in the configuration directory. The
   container root filesystem provides the new user space on top of the running
   kernel of the host.
  </para>
  <para>
   A Linux container has two components: the container root file system stored
   in <filename
   class="directory">/var/lib/lxc/<replaceable>CONTAINER_NAME</replaceable></filename>
   and the container configuration stored in <filename
   class="directory">/etc/lxc/<replaceable>CONTAINER_NAME</replaceable></filename>.
   A container image created by KIWI is packed into a TAR archive containing the
   root filesystem and the configuration. To install it, unpack it at the
   root level (<filename class="directory">/</filename>) of the host system.
   For information on SUSE Linux Enterprise and LXC refer to <ulink url="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_virt/data/part_virt_lxc.html"/>.

  <para>
   Docker is a shipping container system for code that can run virtually
   everywhere. Basically it is an extension of LXC's capabilities. Since
   Docker is based on LXC, a Docker container does not include a separate
   operating system. It relies on the functionality provided by the underlying
   infrastructure. As such, it can package the application and all its
   dependencies in a virtual container which can be run on any Linux server.
  </para>
  <para>
   Docker not only makes it possible to deploy portable containers across
   machines. It also includes versioning capabilities for tracking different
   versions of a container, it allows re-using containers as a base for other
   specialized components, and much more. Find more information about Docker
   on its homepage at <ulink url="http://www.docker.io"/>.

  <title>Building Docker Images</title>

  <para>
   The following example shows how to build a Just enough Operating System
   (JeOS) based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 12:
  </para>

  <screen>kiwi --build suse-SLE12-JeOS --add-profile docker --type docker -d /tmp/my-container</screen>

  <para>
   The image is packed into a TAR archive,
   <filename>/tmp/my-container/LimeJeOS-SLE12-docker.x86_64-1.13.1.tar.xz</filename>
   in this example. To use this image with Docker it must be imported via the
   <command>docker</command> command. The package <package>docker</package>
   needs to be installed and the daemon <systemitem
   class="daemon">dockerd</systemitem> needs to run:
  </para>
  <screen>cat /tmp/my-container/LimeJeOS-SLE12-docker.x86_64-1.13.1.tar.xz |\
docker import - sle12-jeos:new</screen>
  <para>
   Once imported, a container instance can be started as follows:
  </para>
  <screen>docker run --privileged=true -t -i sle12-jeos:new /bin/bash</screen>

  <warning>
   <title>Unpacking the TAR archive</title>
   <para>
    LXC images created by KIWI are packed into a TAR archive and need to be
    unpacked at the root level (<filename class="directory">/</filename>) of the
    host system. <emphasis>Never do this with a Docker TAR archive</emphasis>
    since it would overwrite data on the host system. Always use the
    <command>docker</command> command as described above to import the image.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <title>Image Configuration Details</title>

  <para>
   The configuration for a container does not need to contain a kernel
   package. The container represents the user space that runs on top of the
   kernel of the container host system. However, the container itself must
   include the Linux user space container tools. <remark condition="clarity">
   2015-07-29 - fs: Is this a package? What needs to be done to include these
   tools?</remark>
  </para>

  <para>
   to configure the network for the container use the <sgmltag
   class="element">vmnic</sgmltag> in the
   <filename>config.xml</filename> file as shown below. The
   <sgmltag class="attribute">mode</sgmltag> attribute configures the network
   mode, with <emphasis>veth</emphasis> being the default. 
   <remark condition="clarity">
    2015-07-29 - fs: which other modes are valid?
   </remark>
   
  </para>
  <para>
   Although it is possible to configure multiple network interfaces in the
   <filename>config.xml</filename> file, only the first one is used in the
   container. Prerequisite for a working network in the container is a network
   bridge named <systemitem class="resource">br0</systemitem> configured on
   the host system.  For complex network setups is necessary to edit the
   config file for the container.

    &lt;type ...&gt;
      &lt;machine ...&gt;
        &lt;vmnic interface="0" mode="veth"/&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;</screen>

  <para>
   The generated configuration file restricts the device access of the
   container according to a generally accepted best practice security model.
   The device access permissions may be modified by editing the
   <filename>config</filename> file for the container.
