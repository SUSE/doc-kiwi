    Creating an image often results in an appliance solution for a
    customer and gives you the freedom of a working solution at that
    time. But software develops and you don’t want your solution to
    become outdated. Because of this together with an image people
    always should think of <emphasis>image-maintenance</emphasis>. The
    following paragraph just reflects ideas how to maintain images
    created by KIWI:

  <para>The picture in <xref linkend="fig.maintain"
    xrefstyle="select:label"/> shows two possible
    scenarios which requires an image to become updated. The first
    reason for updating an image are changes to the software, for
    example a new kernel should be used. If this change doesn’t require
    additional software or changes in the configuration the update can
    be done by KIWI itself using its <option>--upgrade</option> option.
    In combination with <option>--upgrade</option> KIWI allows to add
    an additional repository which may be needed if the updated software
    is not part of the original repository. An important thing to know
    is that this additional repository is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    stored into the original <filename>config.xml</filename> file of the
    image description. </para>
  <para>Another reason for updating an image beside software updates are
    configuration changes or enhancements, for example an image should
    have replaced its browser with another better browser or a new
    service like apache should be enabled. In principle it’s possible to
    do all those changes manually within the unpacked image root tree but
    concerning maintenance this would be a nightmare. Why, because it
    will leave the system in an unversioned condition. Nobody knows what
    has changed since the very first preparation of this image. So in
    short:</para>

      <secondary>unpacked image</secondary>
    </indexterm>
  <blockquote>
    <para>Don’t modify the unpacked image root tree manually!</para>
  </blockquote>
  <para>Changes to the image configuration should be done within the
    image description. The image description itself should be part of a
    versioning system like git. All changes can be tracked down
    then and maybe more important can be assigned to product tags and
    branches. As a consequence an image must be prepared from scratch
    and the old unpacked image root tree could be removed. </para>
