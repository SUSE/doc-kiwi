  The KIWI image build process uses the distribution package management
  system to install the specified packages into the unpacked image tree that
  forms the basis for the target image. Installation of these packages
  requires KIWI to import the GPG keys from the build system to the target
  system. This allows signature verification of the package signatures, but
  also implies that repositories used to build the image are also know on
  the build host. Using a repository for image building if that signing key
  is not in the build system key ring will break the image build. After the
  unpacked image tree is created and the package installation is complete
  the GPG keys are removed from from the key ring of the image root system.
